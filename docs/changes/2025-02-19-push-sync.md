# 2025-02-19 Event-driven sync

- `lst-syncd` no longer polls the server every 30 seconds. It now keeps a persistent WebSocket session, syncs immediately when the file watcher sees local edits, and processes server broadcasts in real time. The `interval_seconds` option only applies if the daemon cannot maintain the push channel.
- Added the same trigger-based flow to the mobile sync runtime: local edits flush immediately, and a lightweight listener wakes the sync manager whenever the server broadcasts `NewChanges`. The 30-second timer now acts purely as a fallback.
- Updated the sample config, README, and mobile background service so documentation matches the new push-first behavior.
